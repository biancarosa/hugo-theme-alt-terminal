# Hi there

My name is Bianca and this is a fork of the [Terminal theme](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) originally created by [Radek](https://github.com/panr). I made some personal modifications to better suit my needs.

## What's new in this fork

- **Extended right side section** - configurable sidebar with cards for featured content
- **Flexible layout** - main content and sidebar displayed side by side
- **Extended header section** - customizable header area

## Original features

The original theme includes:

- **5 duotone themes**, depending on your preferences (orange, red, blue, green, pink)
- [**Fira Code**](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) as default monospaced font. It's gorgeous!
- **really nice, custom duotone** syntax highlighting based on [**PrismJS**](https://prismjs.com)
- mobile friendly layout

Thanks to Radek for creating such a great base theme!
